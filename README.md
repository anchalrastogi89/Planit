About Planit Automation-

This project is built on Page Object Modal design pattern in Selenium Java. We can run the tests in two different ways:-
1. By testng.xml
2. By individual testcases file.

ContactPageTestcase.java - Files consists of two testcases related to adding contact. Have used excel file as a testdata.
AddProductTestcase.java - This works on the last testcase in which we add items and calculate the total.
